              <p>
                6.1 Copyright If you believe in good faith that materials
                transmitted or created through the Website infringe your
                copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting
                that we remove the material or block access to it. Please
                provide the following information in writing:
              </p>
              <p>
                a. an electronic or physical signature of the owner (or person
                authorized to act on behalf of the owner) of the copyrighted
                work;
              </p>
              <p>
                b. a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been
                infringed upon and sufficient information for us to locate such
                copyrighted work;
              </p>
              <p>c. Your address, telephone number, and e-mail address;</p>

              <p>
                d. a statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the
                disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its
                agent, or the law;
              </p>
              <p>
                e. a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the
                above information in your notice is accurate and that you are
                the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright
                owner's behalf. We will 1) take proper preliminary actions
                against said alleged infringement within 1-3 days after receipt
                of said information, including without limitation link blockage;
                2) notify the alleged infringer and demand him or her to explain
                and provide counter evidence.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed a
                notice of copyright infringement against you, you may send us a
                counter-notice. If you do, we will notify the alleged claimant
                and hold process for 10-14 days and then re-enable your content
                unless the copyright owner initiates a legal action against you
                before then. Our counter-notice form, set forth below, may be
                referenced to the forms recommended by the DMCA statute, which
                can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office's official website:
                http://www.copyright.gov. If counter-notice is not filed within
                7 days, we will review and process the notice in accordance with
                the contents of the notice. Notices and counter-notices should
                be sent to us via email at: feedback@emojis.ai.

              <p>
                If you believe in good faith that materials in or to the Website
                infringe your other rights, you (or your agent) may send us a
                notice requesting that we remove the material or block access to
                it. Please provide relevant information that could prove basic
                facts of infringement in writing when you contact us.
              </p>
              <p>
                6.3 We have the right to suspend or terminate the use of the
                Website by anyone engaged in suspected repeated any infringement
                involved above.
